# 6-PLACES-CLASSIFICATION
Our project focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, specifically MobileNet transfer learning, to develop a robust image classification model capable of distinguishing between six distinct environmental categories. The targeted classes include 'buildings,' 'forest,' 'glacier,' 'mountain,' 'sea,' and 'street.'
